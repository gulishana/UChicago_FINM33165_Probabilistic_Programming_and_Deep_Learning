( 2 ) xxmaj see,xxbos xxmaj an impairment loss would be recognized for amortizable intangible assets and property , plant and equipment when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from use of the asset are less than its carrying amount . xxmaj management determines fair value by estimating future cash flows as a result of forecasting sales and costs . xxmaj impairment , if any , is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long - lived asset exceeds its fair value . xxmaj no factors indicating the carrying value of our tangible long - lived assets may not be recoverable were present in fiscal 2015 , and accordingly , no impairment 49 xxmaj table of xxmaj contents testing was performed on these assets . xxmaj no factors indicating the carrying value of our long - lived assets may not be recoverable were present in fiscal 2014 , and accordingly , no impairment testing was performed on these assets . xxmaj however , due to changes in our operations and related plans for future xxup sap xxunk , we determined that certain software costs previously incurred had no future value and accordingly , a charge of $ 5.9 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 . xxmaj should market conditions or the assumptions used by us in determining the fair value of assets change , or management change plans regarding the future usage of certain assets , additional charges to operations may be required in the period in which such conditions occur . xxmaj accruals for xxmaj self - xxmaj insurance xxmaj we maintain insurance for certain risks , including workers compensation , general liability and vehicle liability , and are self - insured for employee related health care benefits . xxmaj our workers compensation , general liability and vehicle liability insurance policies include deductibles of $ 250,000 to $ 350,000 per occurrence , with a separate deductible of $ 50,000 for physical damage . xxmaj we maintain excess loss insurance that covers any health care claims in excess of $ 700,000 per person per year . xxmaj we maintain a self - insurance reserve for losses , determined with assistance from a third party actuary , based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of the ultimate loss amount inherent in the claims , including losses for claims incurred but not reported . xxmaj any actuarial projection of losses concerning workers compensation and general liability is subject to a high degree of variability . xxmaj among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates , discount rates , litigation trends , legal interpretations , benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns . xxmaj we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self - insurance liabilities . xxmaj however , any differences in estimates and assumptions could result in accrual requirements materially different from the calculated accruals . xxmaj acquisitions xxmaj in connection with businesses we acquire , management must determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed . xxmaj considerable judgment and estimates are required to determine such amounts , particularly as they relate to identifiable intangible assets , and the applicable useful lives related thereto . xxmaj under different assumptions , the resulting valuations could be materially different , which could materially impact the operating results we report . xxmaj our contractual commitments are presented under the caption xxmaj liquidity and xxmaj capital xxmaj resources .,xxbos impaired , we will record an impairment loss for the difference between the net book value of the properties and the fair value of the properties . xxmaj the fair value of the properties typically is estimated using discounted cash flows . 43 xxmaj we may also recognize impairments of capitalized costs for unproved properties . xxmaj the greatest portion of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leasehold . xxmaj the costs are capitalized and periodically evaluated as to recoverability , based on changes brought about by exploration activities , changes in economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management . xxmaj we consider a combination of geologic and economic factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these costs . xxmaj certain impairments were recognized during 2015 as discussed under xxmaj asset xxmaj impairment in our xxmaj results of xxmaj operations . a further decline in our price assumptions by 10 percent ( assuming all other assumptions are held constant ) would result in approximately $ 240 million of impairment expense on properties , primarily in the xxmaj central xxmaj basin xxmaj platform , not impaired at xxmaj december 31 , 2015 . xxmaj no additional expense would be recognized on properties previously impaired . xxmaj other assumptions such as operating costs , transportation costs , well and reservoir performance , severance and ad valorem taxes , operating and development plans may also change given an assumed 10 percent commodity price decline . xxmaj however , we are unable to estimate their correlation to the price change and these other assumptions may worsen or partially mitigate some of the estimated impairment . xxmaj derivatives : xxmaj xxunk periodically enters into derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to oil , natural gas liquids and natural gas price volatility . xxmaj we enter into derivative transactions that are accounted for as mark - to - market transactions with gains and losses reported in current period gain ( loss ) on derivative instruments , net . xxmaj xxunk does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading purposes . xxmaj the use of derivative contracts to mitigate price risk may cause the xxmaj company s financial position , results of operations and cash flow to be materially different from results that would have been obtained had such risk mitigation activities not occurred . xxmaj asset xxmaj retirement xxmaj obligation : xxmaj xxunk records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred . xxmaj subsequent to initial measurement , liabilities are required to be accreted to their present value each period and capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related assets . xxmaj upon settlement of the liability , xxmaj xxunk will settle the obligation for its recorded amount and recognize the resulting gain or loss . xxmaj xxunk has an obligation to remove tangible equipment and restore land at the end of oil and natural gas production operations . xxmaj the estimate of future restoration and removal costs includes numerous assumptions and uncertainties , including but not limited to , inflation factors , discount rates , timing of settlement , and changes in contractual , regulatory , political , environmental , safety and public relations considerations . xxup recent xxup pronouncements xxup of xxup the xxup financial xxup accounting xxup standards xxup board xxmaj see xxmaj note 19 , xxmaj recently xxmaj issued xxmaj accounting xxmaj standards , in the xxmaj notes to xxmaj financial xxmaj statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards . 44,xxbos collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business . xxmaj in times of domestic or global economic turmoil , our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods . xxmaj if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low , costs and expenses may increase in future periods , and if it is too high , costs and expenses may decrease in future periods . xxmaj contingencies and xxmaj litigation xxmaj we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and , as required , have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims . xxmaj these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results , assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies . xxmaj it is possible , however , that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings . xxmaj see xxmaj note 14 to the xxmaj consolidated xxmaj financial xxmaj statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure . xxmaj income xxmaj tax xxmaj audits xxmaj as a matter of course , the xxmaj company is regularly audited by federal , state and foreign tax authorities . xxmaj from time to time , these audits result in proposed assessments . xxmaj our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel , where appropriate , and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings ( or negotiations ) with taxing and legal authorities . xxmaj the tax benefits ultimately realized by the xxmaj company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors , including the xxmaj company s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter , relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the xxmaj company s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities . 46 xxup table xxup of xxup contents xxup forward - xxup looking xxup statements xxmaj the xxmaj private xxmaj securities xxmaj litigation xxmaj reform xxmaj act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward - looking statements made by or on behalf of the xxmaj company . xxmaj we may from time to time make written or oral statements that are forward -

drilling exploratory work ( i.e. , seismic acquisitions ) in existing and newly sought license areas and the costs associated with extended delays in undertaking the required exploratory work , which is typical of what we have experienced in the past , or plugging and abandoning activities . xxmaj we are considering various alternatives with respect to raising additional capital but to date have no commitments for such financing . xxmaj we expect that when we seek to raise additional capital it will be through the sale of equity securities , debt or other financing arrangements . xxmaj because of the absence of any oil and natural gas reserves , there can be no assurance this capital will be available and if it is not , we may be forced to substantially curtail or cease exploration , appraisal and development expenditures . xxmaj tabular xxmaj disclosure of xxmaj contractual xxmaj obligations xxmaj the following summarizes our contractual financial obligations for continuing operations at xxmaj december 31 , 2012 and the effect such obligations is expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods . xxmaj payment due by period ( in xxmaj thousands of xxup usd ) 2013 2014 2015 2016 xxmaj thereafter xxmaj total xxmaj exploration xxmaj related xxmaj commitments 1,511 -

lived asset exceeds its fair value . xxmaj no factors indicating the carrying value of our tangible long - lived assets may not be recoverable were present in fiscal 2015 , and accordingly , no impairment 49 xxmaj table of xxmaj contents testing was performed on these assets . xxmaj no factors indicating the carrying value of our long -

xxmaj insurance xxmaj we maintain insurance for certain risks , including workers compensation , general liability and vehicle liability , and are self - insured for employee related health care benefits . xxmaj our workers compensation , general liability and vehicle liability insurance policies include deductibles of $ 250,000 to $ 350,000 per occurrence , with a separate deductible of $ 50,000 for physical damage . xxmaj we maintain excess loss insurance that covers any health care claims in excess of $ 700,000 per person per year . xxmaj we maintain a self - insurance reserve for losses , determined with assistance from a third party actuary , based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of the ultimate loss amount inherent in the claims , including losses for claims incurred but not reported . xxmaj any actuarial projection of losses concerning workers compensation and general liability is subject to a high degree of variability . xxmaj among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates , discount rates , litigation trends , legal interpretations , benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns . xxmaj we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self - insurance liabilities . xxmaj however , any differences in estimates and assumptions could result in accrual requirements materially different from the calculated accruals . xxmaj acquisitions xxmaj in connection with businesses we acquire , management must determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed . xxmaj considerable judgment and estimates are required to determine such amounts , particularly as they relate to identifiable intangible assets , and the applicable useful lives related thereto . xxmaj under different assumptions , the resulting valuations could be materially different , which could materially impact the operating results we report . xxmaj our contractual commitments are presented under the caption xxmaj liquidity and xxmaj capital xxmaj resources .,xxbos impaired , we will record an impairment loss for the difference between the net book value of the properties and the fair value of the properties . xxmaj the fair value of the properties typically is estimated using discounted cash flows . 43 xxmaj we may also recognize impairments of capitalized costs for unproved properties . xxmaj the greatest portion of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leasehold . xxmaj the costs are capitalized and periodically evaluated as to recoverability , based on changes brought about by exploration activities , changes in economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management . xxmaj we consider a combination of geologic and economic factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these costs . xxmaj certain impairments were recognized during 2015 as discussed under xxmaj asset xxmaj impairment in our xxmaj results of xxmaj operations . a further decline in our price assumptions by 10 percent ( assuming all other assumptions are held constant ) would result in approximately $ 240 million of impairment expense on properties , primarily in the xxmaj central xxmaj basin xxmaj platform , not impaired at xxmaj december 31 , 2015 . xxmaj no additional expense would be recognized on properties previously impaired . xxmaj other assumptions such as operating costs , transportation costs , well and reservoir performance , severance and ad valorem taxes , operating and development plans may also change given an assumed 10 percent commodity price decline . xxmaj however , we are unable to estimate their correlation to the price change and these other assumptions may worsen or partially mitigate some of the estimated impairment . xxmaj derivatives : xxmaj xxunk periodically enters into derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to oil , natural gas liquids and natural gas price volatility . xxmaj we enter into derivative transactions that are accounted for as mark - to - market transactions with gains and losses reported in current period gain ( loss ) on derivative instruments , net . xxmaj xxunk does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading purposes . xxmaj the use of derivative contracts to mitigate price risk may cause the xxmaj company s financial position , results of operations and cash flow to be materially different from results that would have been obtained had such risk mitigation activities not occurred . xxmaj asset xxmaj retirement xxmaj obligation : xxmaj xxunk records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred . xxmaj subsequent to initial measurement , liabilities are required to be accreted to their present value each period and capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related assets . xxmaj upon settlement of the liability , xxmaj xxunk will settle the obligation for its recorded amount and recognize the resulting gain or loss . xxmaj xxunk has an obligation to remove tangible equipment and restore land at the end of oil and natural gas production operations . xxmaj the estimate of future restoration and removal costs includes numerous assumptions and uncertainties , including but not limited to , inflation factors , discount rates , timing of settlement , and changes in contractual , regulatory , political , environmental , safety and public relations considerations . xxup recent xxup pronouncements xxup of xxup the xxup financial xxup accounting xxup standards xxup board xxmaj see xxmaj note 19 , xxmaj recently xxmaj issued xxmaj accounting xxmaj standards , in the xxmaj notes to xxmaj financial xxmaj statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards . 44,xxbos collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business . xxmaj in times of domestic or global economic turmoil , our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods . xxmaj if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low , costs and expenses may increase in future periods , and if it is too high , costs and expenses may decrease in future periods . xxmaj contingencies and xxmaj litigation xxmaj we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and , as required , have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims . xxmaj these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results , assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies . xxmaj it is possible , however , that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings . xxmaj see xxmaj note 14 to the xxmaj consolidated xxmaj financial xxmaj statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure . xxmaj income xxmaj tax xxmaj audits xxmaj as a matter of course , the xxmaj company is regularly audited by federal , state and foreign tax authorities . xxmaj from time to time , these audits result in proposed assessments . xxmaj our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel , where appropriate , and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings ( or negotiations ) with taxing and legal authorities . xxmaj the tax benefits ultimately realized by the xxmaj company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors , including the xxmaj company s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter , relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the xxmaj company s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities . 46 xxup table xxup of xxup contents xxup forward -

drilling exploratory work ( i.e. , seismic acquisitions ) in existing and newly sought license areas and the costs associated with extended delays in undertaking the required exploratory work , which is typical of what we have experienced in the past , or plugging and abandoning activities . xxmaj we are considering various alternatives with respect to raising additional capital but to date have no commitments for such financing . xxmaj we expect that when we seek to raise additional capital it will be through the sale of equity securities , debt or other financing arrangements . xxmaj because of the absence of any oil and natural gas reserves , there can be no assurance this capital will be available and if it is not , we may be forced to substantially curtail or cease exploration , appraisal and development expenditures . xxmaj tabular xxmaj disclosure of xxmaj contractual xxmaj obligations xxmaj the following summarizes our contractual financial obligations for continuing operations at xxmaj december 31 , 2012 and the effect such obligations is expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods . xxmaj payment due by period ( in xxmaj thousands of xxup usd ) 2013 2014 2015 2016 xxmaj thereafter xxmaj total xxmaj exploration xxmaj related xxmaj commitments 1,511 -

lived asset exceeds its fair value . xxmaj no factors indicating the carrying value of our tangible long - lived assets may not be recoverable were present in fiscal 2015 , and accordingly , no impairment 49 xxmaj table of xxmaj contents testing was performed on these assets . xxmaj no factors indicating the carrying value of our long - lived assets may not be recoverable were present in fiscal 2014 , and accordingly , no impairment testing was performed on these assets . xxmaj however , due to changes in our operations and related plans for future xxup sap xxunk , we determined that certain software costs previously incurred had no future value and accordingly , a charge of $ 5.9 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 . xxmaj should market conditions or the assumptions used by us in determining the fair value of assets change , or management change plans regarding the future usage of certain assets , additional charges to operations may be required in the period in which such conditions occur . xxmaj accruals for xxmaj self - xxmaj insurance xxmaj we maintain insurance for certain risks , including workers compensation , general liability and vehicle liability , and are self - insured for employee related health care benefits . xxmaj our workers compensation , general liability and vehicle liability insurance policies include deductibles of $ 250,000 to $ 350,000 per occurrence , with a separate deductible of $ 50,000 for physical damage . xxmaj we maintain excess loss insurance that covers any health care claims in excess of $ 700,000 per person per year . xxmaj we maintain a self - insurance reserve for losses , determined with assistance from a third party actuary , based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of the ultimate loss amount inherent in the claims , including losses for claims incurred but not reported . xxmaj any actuarial projection of losses concerning workers compensation and general liability is subject to a high degree of variability . xxmaj among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates , discount rates , litigation trends , legal interpretations , benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns . xxmaj we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self - insurance liabilities . xxmaj however , any differences in estimates and assumptions could result in accrual requirements materially different from the calculated accruals . xxmaj acquisitions xxmaj in connection with businesses we acquire , management must determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed . xxmaj considerable judgment and estimates are required to determine such amounts , particularly as they relate to identifiable intangible assets , and the applicable useful lives related thereto . xxmaj under different assumptions , the resulting valuations could be materially different , which could materially impact the operating results we report . xxmaj our contractual commitments are presented under the caption xxmaj liquidity and xxmaj capital xxmaj resources .,xxbos impaired , we will record an impairment loss for the difference between the net book value of the properties and the fair value of the properties . xxmaj the fair value of the properties typically is estimated using discounted cash flows . 43 xxmaj we may also recognize impairments of capitalized costs for unproved properties . xxmaj the greatest portion of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leasehold . xxmaj the costs are capitalized and periodically evaluated as to recoverability , based on changes brought about by exploration activities , changes in economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management . xxmaj we consider a combination of geologic and economic factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these costs . xxmaj certain impairments were recognized during 2015 as discussed under xxmaj asset xxmaj impairment in our xxmaj results of xxmaj operations . a further decline in our price assumptions by 10 percent ( assuming all other assumptions are held constant ) would result in approximately $ 240 million of impairment expense on properties , primarily in the xxmaj central xxmaj basin xxmaj platform , not impaired at xxmaj december 31 , 2015 . xxmaj no additional expense would be recognized on properties previously impaired . xxmaj other assumptions such as operating costs , transportation costs , well and reservoir performance , severance and ad valorem taxes , operating and development plans may also change given an assumed 10 percent commodity price decline . xxmaj however , we are unable to estimate their correlation to the price change and these other assumptions may worsen or partially mitigate some of the estimated impairment . xxmaj derivatives : xxmaj xxunk periodically enters into derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to oil , natural gas liquids and natural gas price volatility . xxmaj we enter into derivative transactions that are accounted for as mark - to - market transactions with gains and losses reported in current period gain ( loss ) on derivative instruments , net . xxmaj xxunk does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading purposes . xxmaj the use of derivative contracts to mitigate price risk may cause the xxmaj company s financial position , results of operations and cash flow to be materially different from results that would have been obtained had such risk mitigation activities not occurred . xxmaj asset xxmaj retirement xxmaj obligation : xxmaj xxunk records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred . xxmaj subsequent to initial measurement , liabilities are required to be accreted to their present value each period and capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related assets . xxmaj upon settlement of the liability , xxmaj xxunk will settle the obligation for its recorded amount and recognize the resulting gain or loss . xxmaj xxunk has an obligation to remove tangible equipment and restore land at the end of oil and natural gas production operations . xxmaj the estimate of future restoration and removal costs includes numerous assumptions and uncertainties , including but not limited to , inflation factors , discount rates , timing of settlement , and changes in contractual , regulatory , political , environmental , safety and public relations considerations . xxup recent xxup pronouncements xxup of xxup the xxup financial xxup accounting xxup standards xxup board xxmaj see xxmaj note 19 , xxmaj recently xxmaj issued xxmaj accounting xxmaj standards , in the xxmaj notes to xxmaj financial xxmaj statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards . 44,xxbos collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business . xxmaj in times of domestic or global economic turmoil , our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods . xxmaj if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low , costs and expenses may increase in future periods , and if it is too high , costs and expenses may decrease in future periods . xxmaj contingencies and xxmaj litigation xxmaj we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and , as required , have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims . xxmaj these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results , assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies . xxmaj it is possible , however , that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings . xxmaj see xxmaj note 14 to the xxmaj consolidated xxmaj financial xxmaj statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure . xxmaj income xxmaj tax xxmaj audits xxmaj as a matter of course , the xxmaj company is regularly audited by federal , state and foreign tax authorities . xxmaj from time to time , these audits result in proposed assessments . xxmaj our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel , where appropriate , and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings ( or negotiations ) with taxing and legal authorities . xxmaj the tax benefits ultimately realized by the xxmaj company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors , including the xxmaj company s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter , relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the xxmaj company s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities . 46 xxup table xxup of xxup contents xxup forward -

drilling exploratory work ( i.e. , seismic acquisitions ) in existing and newly sought license areas and the costs associated with extended delays in undertaking the required exploratory work , which is typical of what we have experienced in the past , or plugging and abandoning activities . xxmaj we are considering various alternatives with respect to raising additional capital but to date have no commitments for such financing . xxmaj we expect that when we seek to raise additional capital it will be through the sale of equity securities , debt or other financing arrangements . xxmaj because of the absence of any oil and natural gas reserves , there can be no assurance this capital will be available and if it is not , we may be forced to substantially curtail or cease exploration , appraisal and development expenditures . xxmaj tabular xxmaj disclosure of xxmaj contractual xxmaj obligations xxmaj the following summarizes our contractual financial obligations for continuing operations at xxmaj december 31 , 2012 and the effect such obligations is expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods . xxmaj payment due by period ( in xxmaj thousands of xxup usd ) 2013 2014 2015 2016 xxmaj thereafter xxmaj total xxmaj exploration xxmaj related xxmaj commitments 1,511 -

    "According to above classification results, the accuracy for each model is shown as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- (1) **1 day**: the 7th epoch has the highest accuracy, which is 0.489491.\n",
    "- (2) **1 week**: the 5th epoch has the highest accuracy, which is 0.444220.\n",
    "- (3) **2 weeks**: the 3th epoch has the highest accuracy, which is 0.470897.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can see that the 1-day model has the best performance, i.e. highest accuracy, followed by 2-week model. And the 1-week model has the worst performance. However, all the three models have accuracies that are much higher than a random model whose accuracy would be only about 0.33.\n",

    "As a result, we may conclude that the texts in the 10-K forms can be used to predict the performance of the company's stock performance after the release of the 10-K forms. And it provides the best prediction for the stock performance 1 day after releasing 10-K forms."
